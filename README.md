# Predicting prices of ML books

This project consists of three parts:
* Scraping prices of ML books from [Book Depository](https://www.bookdepository.com/).
  - notebook: [Scraping the Web](https://github.com/peiyiHung/Predicting-prices-of-ML-books/blob/main/Scaping%20the%20web.ipynb)
* Clean the data we scrapped from the website.
  - notebook: [Cleaning1](https://github.com/peiyiHung/Predicting-prices-of-ML-books/blob/main/Cleaning1.ipynb), [Cleaning2](https://github.com/peiyiHung/Predicting-prices-of-ML-books/blob/main/Cleaning2.ipynb), [Cleaning3](https://github.com/peiyiHung/Predicting-prices-of-ML-books/blob/main/Cleaning1.ipynb)
* Explore the data and Build ML models
  - notebook: [Predicting prices of Machine Learning books](https://github.com/peiyiHung/Predicting-prices-of-ML-books/blob/main/Predicting%20prices%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Books.ipynb)
